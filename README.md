Emergent
========
Emergent is an experimental project with a full access for everyone. Send a pull request and you'll be added as a contributor. Main idea is to organize ourselves and create something exciting.

## Programming language
It's supposed to be written in Python. This may change during the process of evolution.

## Libraries and server configurations
We decided to use Django on this stage. There is a basic Django installation ready to use. Python requirements are installing automatically from requirements.txt.

We are at the very beginning right now and it's not very clear how to interact with the server. So if you need specific configurations or libraries feel free to write directly to the author https://github.com/averrin

Now database is Sqlite. Django admin's creds - admin:admin.
