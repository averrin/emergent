Emergent
========
Emergent is an experimental project with a full access for everyone.
Send a pull request and you'll be added as a contributor.
Main idea is to organize ourselves and create something exciting.

## Programming language
It's supposed to be written in Python.

## Libraries and server configurations
We are at the very beginning right now and it's not very clear how to interact with the server.
So if you want any specific configuration or libraries feel free to open an issue,
or talk to [@averrin](https://github.com/averrin).

### Django
We decided to use Django on this stage. There is a basic Django installation ready to use.
Python requirements are installing automatically from
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/averrin/emergent/blob/master/requirements.txt).

### SQLite
The database of choice is, for now, SQLite. Django admin's credentials are `admin:admin`.
