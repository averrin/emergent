Emergent
========
Experimental project with a full access for everyone. Send a pull request and you'll be added as a contributor. Main idea is to organize ourselves and create something exciting. 

## Programming language
It's supposed to be wrote in Python. There is a tiny framework Bottle installed on the server. But we it may change during the process of evolution.

## Libraries and server configurations
We are on the very start and it's not totally clear how to interact with the server. So if you need specific configurations or libraries feel free to write directly to the author https://github.com/averrin
